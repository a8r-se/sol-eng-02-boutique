**Online Boutique and Telepresence**
Please note that this cluster is leveraging ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts.
All Online Boutique deployments are configured to use the Telepresence Mutating Webhook  

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like
Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application
works on any Kubernetes cluster (such as a local one), as well as Google
Kubernetes Engine. It’s **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

## Service Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Stackdriver APM](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.

## Installation

For all installation options, see [the project's original README.md](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)

### Prerequisites

   - kubectl (can be installed via `gcloud components install kubectl`)
   - [edgectl](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/tutorials/getting-started/)
   - [skaffold]( https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/) ([ensure version ≥v1.10](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/releases))

### Running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

1.  Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster with at least 4 nodes, and make sure `kubectl` is pointing to the cluster.

    ```sh
    # Using the Datawire kubectl-gke plugin
    kubectl gke create --node-count 4
    ```

2.  Install Ambassador Edge Stack, with Traffic-Agent RBAC in the `default` namespace.

    ```sh
    edgectl install
    
    kubectl apply -f https://getambassador.io/yaml/traffic-agent-rbac.yaml
    ```

3.  Deploy the demo code
    1. **Option 1** - Using Pre-Built Container Images:
    
        Deploy the Boutique app by running 
        
        ```sh
        kubectl apply -n default -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datawire/microservices-demo/master/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
        ```
        
    2. **Option 2** - Building images from scratch:
    
        In the root of this repository, run `skaffold run --default-repo=`,
        where [PUBLIC_REPO] is your Docker Hub repository or GCR `gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]`.
    
        This command:
    
        - builds the container images
        - pushes them to the container registry
        - applies the `./kubernetes-manifests` deploying the application to
          Kubernetes.

### Using Service Preview

See the [Service Preview Quick Start](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/using/edgectl/service-preview-install/) for more information.

The `frontend`, `currencyservice` and `adservice` are already instrumented with annotation and automatically injects the Service Preview Traffic-Agent.

You should be able to connect to the remote cluster:

```sh
sudo edgectl daemon
edgectl connect
```
    
Check the status of the connection and the available intercepts:

```sh
edgectl status
edgectl intercept list
edgectl intercept avail
```
    
Intercept the `frontend` deployment and the `currencyservice` deployment, assuming they are running on your local workstation:

```sh
edgectl intercept add frontend -n my-frontend-intercept -t localhost:8080
```
    
The local `frontend` service is now accessible using the given Preview URL.
Re-use the same UUID token to intercept requests going to the GRPC `currencyservice` as headers are propagated from the `frontend` service to its dependencies:
    
```sh
edgectl intercept add currencyservice -n my-currencyservice-intercept -m "x-service-preview=$UUID$" -t localhost:7000 --grpc
```
